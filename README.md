Introduction to Airbnb :
Founded in August of 2008 and based in San Francisco, California. Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations 
around the world â€” online or from a mobile phone or tablet. Whether a spare bedroom, an apartment, a villa or a private island, Airbnb connects travelers to a more
diverse and authentic range of experiences in over 34,000 cities and 190 countries.

Skills take away From This Project:
Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, Visualization, EDA, Streamlit, MongoDb and PowerBI.

The learning outcomes of this project are:

  1.MongoDB Atlas:  Gain proficiency in working with MongoDB Atlas to store and retrieve the Airbnb dataset, developing skills in data management with a NoSQL database technology.
  
  2.Streamlit Web Application:  Build a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, enhancing skills in web application development for interactive data exploration and visualization.
  
  3.Python Data Analysis:  Utilize Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks, developing expertise in Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  
  4.PowerBI:  Create interactive dashboards using tools like PowerBI, refining skills in data visualization and dashboard creation for comprehensive data presentation.
  
  5.Data Cleaning and Preparation:  Develop proficiency in cleaning and preparing the Airbnb dataset, including handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions, ensuring data quality and consistency.
  
  6.Data Visualization Techniques:  Master data visualization techniques to effectively communicate insights, developing skills in creating visually appealing and informative charts, maps, and plots.
  
  7.Problem-Solving Skills:  Apply analytical skills to analyze pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and other factors, developing problem-solving abilities in extracting valuable insights from data.
  
  8.Data-Driven Decision Making:  Enhance decision-making skills by enabling stakeholders to make informed choices based on the insights and visualizations provided by the project.
  
  9.Collaboration and Project Management:  Strengthen collaboration and project management skills through the end-to-end development of the project, including task planning, coordination, and timely delivery of project milestones.

Goal of the Project:
  Understand the popularity of Airbnb based on locations. Analyze the reason about variation based on locations by prices (which area is expensive), reviews (which area is the best), and type of rooms. 
  Realize the situation of the busyness of the host. Predict the future 2020 Airbnb performance in New York City.
  
Description of Data:

  **location - Provides details about Airbnb location in New York city. Four attributes including neighbourhood_group (main area), neighbourhood (area), longitude, and latitude .
  
  **listings - Detailed listings data about hosts, Airbnb houses and price. The attributes used in the analysis are id (listing ID), name (name of the listing), host_id (host ID), 
    host_name (name of the host), room_type (listing space type), and price (price in dollars).
    
  **reviews - Detailed reviews given by the guests. Key attributes include number_of_reviews (number of reviews), last_review (latest review), and reviews_per_month (number of reviews per month).
  
Conclusion:
  This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, 
  and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.
